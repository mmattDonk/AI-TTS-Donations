# Dashboard Setup

To get started, you'll need to first sign in to the [Solrock Dashboard](https://solrock.mmattdonk.com/dashboard).

After you have signed into the dashboard, you'll be greeted with a page that looks like this:
![Image of the Solrock Dashboard](/img/screenshots/getting-started/dashboard.png)

Here you can see your media controls (such as skipping the current TTS, and looking at past TTS messages to replay them). You can pop these out into a separate window by
clicking the button above the "Skip TTS" button.

## Configuration

Below the media controls, you can see your configuration options. Here, you can set which events you want to trigger the TTS, any blacklisted words, users, voice effects,
max and minimum amounts, and your fallback voice.

### Events

![Image of the Events section in the Solrock Dashboard](/img/screenshots/getting-started/events.png) Setup which events you want to trigger the TTS.

#### Channel Points

Setup which channel point reward you want to trigger the TTS. The reward name **must** be the exact same as in your Twitch Dashboard (Case Sensitive).

Make sure that on Twitch, you require the user to enter text.

#### Resubs

These get triggered when a user resubscribes to your channel, with a message in their resubscription share. You can set the minimum amount of months they need to have for
the TTS to trigger.

#### Bits

These get triggered when a user cheers (aka uses bits) in your channel. You can set the minimum amount of bits they need to cheer for the TTS to trigger.

### Max/Min Amounts

![Image of the Max/Min Amounts section in the Solrock Dashboard](/img/screenshots/getting-started/max-min.png)

Setup the maximum and minimum amount of characters allowed in a TTS message.

### Blacklisted

![Image of the Blacklisted section in the Solrock Dashboard](/img/screenshots/getting-started/blacklisted.png)

Setup the blacklisted words, users, voices, and voice effects.

:::info Seperate each word/user/voice/voice effect with a line break.

(so press enter after each word/user/voice/voice effect)

:::

#### Blacklisted Words

Blacklist any words that you don't want to be said in the TTS. If a message contains any of these words, the TTS will not be triggered.

#### Blacklisted Users

Blacklist any users that you don't want to be able to trigger the TTS. If a message is sent by a blacklisted user, the TTS will not be triggered.

#### Blacklisted Voices

Blacklist any voices that you don't want to be used in the TTS. If a message is sent by a blacklisted voice, the TTS will use the fallback voice.

#### Blacklisted Voice Effects

Blacklist any voice effects that you don't want to be used in the TTS. If a message is sent by a blacklisted voice effect, the TTS will not use that effect.

### Fallbacks

![Image of the Fallbacks section in the Solrock Dashboard](/img/screenshots/getting-started/fallbacks.png)

Here you can set your fallback voice, which will be applied if the voice doesn't exist, or if the voice is blacklisted
