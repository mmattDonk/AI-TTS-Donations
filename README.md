üí∞ A bot that uses Uberduck (and now FakeYou!) AI to make bit donations have an AI voice.

### üëÄ Are you a viewer?
Check the instructions [here!](https://mmatt.link/UseTTS)

### üîß Prerequisites
1. [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ** **MAKE SURE PYTHON IS ADDED TO PATH WHILE INSTALLING.** **
      - This can avoid an error that Python doesn't exist in steps 4/5. To add Python to path after Python has already been installed, please follow [this guide](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
    - This is required for a dependency we use, which is now being built/cloned directly from GitHub. Just simply use the installer, and spam the "Next" button until it starts installing. As usual, join the Discord in case you have problems!
    - You can also install this through the command line on Windows (11?) by using `winget`.
        - `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

### üèÉ How to run
1. Clone the repo
    * You can do `git clone https://github.com/mmattdonk/ai-tts-donations` or just download the ZIP from GitHub
1. Generate your configuration files using this website: https://mmattdonk.github.io/AI-TTS-Donations/
    * Simply enter in the required keys into the website, then download the configuration files and put them into your bot's folder.
1. Install Prerequisits
    * [On Windows] Open the `scripts` folder, then run the `install-python.bat` file and the `install-git.bat` file. This will install everything you need.
    * [On Macos/Linux] Install Python and Git [(using the links above)](#üîß-prerequisites). Then install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
1. Start the bot - Open `bot.py`
    * You can open this in a Terminal too: `python bot.py`

After this, you just login with the website that opens in your default browser, and you are all good to go! If you have any errors/problems, don't be afraid to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2) for help.

### üíª Developers
We use `pre-commit` and `pre-commit.ci` to make sure that Pull Requests are quality, even before you commit your changes.

Use `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install the developer dependencies needed.

To install `pre-commit`, do the `pre-commit install` command.

Need extra logs? Use `python bot.py dev` to launch the bot.
