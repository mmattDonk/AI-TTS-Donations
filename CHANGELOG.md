# Multiple Voices!
This updated adds the support for multiple voices! The reason this is a 'breaking change' is because I changed audio libraries when adding support for multiple voices

To install this new library, go into a terminal into your folder and type:
```
pip install simpleaudio
```

## [v1.5.1](https://github.com/mmattDonk/AI-TTS-Donations/releases/tag/v1.5.1) - 2021-11-05 21:39:39

## Removed `auto update` code.

AI-TTS-Donations used some scuffed auto update code to automatically `git pull` and the reinstall the dependencies. This worked.... fine, but there have been a lot of issues surrounding it, and it really wasn't the best solution at all. I would recommend, if you have the `.git` folder in your bot folder, then you can simply do `git pull` in a terminal that is in that directory. If you don't, you can simply just download the releases from here, I will probably start announcing new versions in the [mmattDonk Discord](https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2), so you could join that to stay in touch. 

And of course, if you need my help, my Twitch Chat `#mmattbtw` and Discord Server https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2 are both great ways to reach me!
