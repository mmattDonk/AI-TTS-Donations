# CHANGELOG

## [v2.6.0](https://github.com/mmattDonk/AI-TTS-Donations/releases/tag/v2.6.0) - 2022-03-11 22:17:44

# Added Version Posting!
Version posting is used for the new API I've built for the new Twitch Extension I've built!


This new Twitch extension is a panel you can add to your Twitch channel, that tells your viewers what features are supported or not on your version of ATD (AI-TTS-Donations). This extension is **not** out yet, as I'm typing this, I am submitting it to Twitch for approval, but you can check it out on [/mmattbtw](https://twitch.tv/mmattbtw/about), [/mmattDonk](https://twitch.tv/mmattDonk/about), and [/LiptonGod](https://twitch.tv/liptongod/about)!

## [v1.5.1](https://github.com/mmattDonk/AI-TTS-Donations/releases/tag/v1.5.1) - 2021-11-05 21:39:39

## Removed `auto update` code.

AI-TTS-Donations used some scuffed auto update code to automatically `git pull` and the reinstall the dependencies. This worked.... fine, but there have been a lot of issues surrounding it, and it really wasn't the best solution at all. I would recommend, if you have the `.git` folder in your bot folder, then you can simply do `git pull` in a terminal that is in that directory. If you don't, you can simply just download the releases from here, I will probably start announcing new versions in the [mmattDonk Discord](https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2), so you could join that to stay in touch. 

And of course, if you need my help, my Twitch Chat `#mmattbtw` and Discord Server https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2 are both great ways to reach me!
