1) **What data does this bot store?**

**None** by default.

If you use the `MM_API_KEY` (mmatt API for the [Twitch Extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/ukchm96ow4u5nykp34y56v8c14refh-0.0.1)) then we store your 1. Twitch ID and 2. AI TTS Donations Version Number.

2) **Why do we need the data, and why do we use this data?** (for the mmatt API for the Twitch Extension)

    a) We use the Twitch ID to connect the Twitch Extension panel to your specific version number

    b) We use the version number to show what features are supported.

3) **Do we share your data with any 3rd parties?**

**None** by default.

You can opt in to share your version number and Twitch ID with mmatt when you use the `MM_API_KEY` (mmatt API)

4) **How can users get data removed, or how can users contact the bot owner?**

They can contact me via email `mmattbtw@pm.me`.
