2. [Generate the necessary configuration files](https://mmattdonk.github.io/AI-TTS-Donations/).
    * Simply enter in the required keys into the website, then download the configuration files and put them into your bot's folder (where `bot.py` is!).
3. Install Dependencies - Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in a Terminal/PowerShell/Command Prompt window (that is in the same directory as the bot.py file)
4. Start the bot - Run `python bot.py` in a Terminal/PowerShell/Command Prompt window
