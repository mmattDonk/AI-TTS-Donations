# backend

The backend Express server handling Twitch Eventsub that is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=mmatt) (referral link)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
2. Start the Express server in development mode with `pnpm dev`

(dev note: this SHOULD be on `frontend`/next.js because next.js IS a backend framework, but i would need to redirect eventsub.mmattdonk.com -->
staging.solrock.mmattdonk.com and that'd be really annoying, but i'll figure it out one day)
